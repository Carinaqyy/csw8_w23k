Dear all,

We know that this is a really challenging part of the quarter for everyone. Many of you are trying to do your best and are working really hard. Please remember to take breaks, stretch, and drink water!

Since Week 8 labs were a preparation for the final project, we are hoping that you are more aware how unwise it would be to leave working on your code until a few days before the deadline.

Because some of the Week 8 labs and main program structure are going to be needed for the final project, we'd like to encourage those of you who didn't finish your code yesterday to still make progress on it.

We have created an new Gradescope assignment "Week 8: Labs Extension". It will allow you to submit your code until **this Friday, May 27 at 10PM**. This extension applies to everyone in the class, so if you had previously submitted an extension request, we won't be counting it against you. 

If you had submitted your code by the original Wednesday deadline, a percentage of that score will be added to your lab grade as a bonus - good job and thank you for ensuring that you get your work done on time! If you got full credit for it, there's nothing else for you to do (you do not need to resubmit it again).

If you had or want to submit an extra credit in those labs (i.e., the option to write the `all_grades` list to the CSV file and read it back from the file (Chapter 10 material) - then please add those functions to the file called **extra_credit.py** (remember to `import` it in your **main.py**).

We hope this helps!

All the best wishes with all that you are juggling!

Prof. K and the Mentors
