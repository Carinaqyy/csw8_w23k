# üé∞ Week 7: Lists and Dictionaries

Happy Weekend! 

Two months ago we were celebrating Pie Day (3.14)... can has pie now?

We hope you all had a great week! With just 1/3rd of the course left, we hope you are making sure that you are taking good care of yourselves before we get into the final stretch of the quarter.

 - Week 7 was about working with lists and dictionaries, and the different methods that we can use with them.
    - Helpful list methods included, for example, `append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `extend()`, `sort()` (in place!) 
    - Dictionaries used `get()`, `update()`, `pop()`, `clear()`, and much more. 
    -  We encourage you to practice writing code from scratch using different methods for lists and dictionaries.
 - During labs, we went over some important concepts on lists and dictionaries and how to use different methods with them, like list slicing, list iteration etc. We also reviewed nested lists.

## ‚è∞ Week 7 and 8 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

As you can see on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-7), the remaining due date this week includes:
* ‚è∞  **Sunday 10PM**: Weekly reflection - the link to it is available under the **Week 7 tab** on Gauchospace
    - we hope that you like the little cartoons that we added there for you :-)

The deadlines **next week** are:
* ‚è∞ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA08**
* ‚è∞ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA08**
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA07** - all non-optional Week 7 zyLabs
* ‚è∞ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA08 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 8 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ‚è∞ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace

Quiz 5 has been graded and released - you should have received an email from Gradescope titled "_Your Quiz 5 (week7) for CSW 8, Spring 2022 has been graded_".
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday 10PM** Regrade requests are Due on **Gradescope**
    * Note regarding regrade-requests: After the quiz grades are released, students can submit a regrade request on Gradescope as described here: [{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/quiz]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/quiz).
    * For Gradescope quizzes always use the regrade request button (**not email or the forum**).


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track in Week 8

* Work on completing this week's lab activities (LA07) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions (you have a full day of them! attend any to ask your questions), or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) 
* By the end of Sunday: Ideally, you should be finished with PAs for Chapter 8 and done with the CAs for its first 4-5 sections.

üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 8]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-8), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Remember that unlike lists and dictionaries **strings are immutable**! üíé
    - Note that string methods **return a new string object** instead of modifying the string you asked it to operate on.
    - The "üìé Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.
* Write down anything that's unclear and if you have any questions to ask during class
* Practice writing code from scratch using your IDE.



## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources

* Just a reminder: you can find these announcements on the [main course website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/) as well as under the [**Instructor Announcements** on Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/forum/view.php?id=1014718) (which is supposed to email it to you automatically).

* Check out this helpful resource on [lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) and [dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp). We encourage you to try out the examples there and don‚Äôt hesitate to use print statements to understand what each method does -- it's an excellent debugging technique!

* Join us on Piazza either for the [mindfulness challenge](https://piazza.com/class/l1ca0xuimie3f9?cid=243) or to [try out the fun game](https://piazza.com/class/l1ca0xuimie3f9?cid=276) that one of your classmates put together. The idea for the user interaction is very similar to what you'll be doing in your final project. ;-)

* Here's a fun reflection by a digital artist: [How I Developed My Art Style Over 2 Years - Daily Drawing & Lots Of Practice!](https://youtu.be/DIaGLEIYYdo). Seems to apply to learning how to program as well. ;-P

The quarter is beginning to pick up its pace and the workload is naturally increasing in all courses. This weekend, take a moment and look over your schedule and make sure to add some breaks and fun things to it.

It is time to replenish.' /></a>

We hope you‚Äôll also get to recharge yourselves over the weekend :). Wishing you all a restorative weekend!
