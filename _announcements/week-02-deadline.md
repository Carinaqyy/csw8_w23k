title: ⏰ Deadlines extended
week: 0
date: 2022-04-06

Dear all,

I was informed this morning that there was an issue with the waitlist, so it stayed open much longer than we were expecting. 


This is a very fast-paced course, so you need to ensure that you are keeping track of the due dates and are proactively keeping up with (or staying ahead of) the course material. The material will build on itself every week, but things will get much easier with practice.

TO accommodate students who were added late and give them a little more time for practice, the whole class gets the benefit of an extended deadline.

⏰  **tomorrow (Thursday, April 7) at 10PM**, we will collect everyone's scores from zyBooks for the following activities:

* PA01, CA01, LA01
* PA02, CA02, LA02 Checkpoint
LA01 Checkpoint is not covered by this extension - instead, just make sure that you finished the labs from last week. 



From now on, any extension that you request, it will need to be submitted through the form, linked in our Syllabus:
<https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/about/#deadline-extension-for-zybook-activities>

We do not provide individual extensions that are not submitted through this form. 



As I mentioned in class on Tuesday, if you see your PA01/02 scores on Gauchospace's gradebook, then your student ID is correct and you can skip the rest of this message. 

Otherwise, you need to **fix your student ID in zybooks**. Go to "My Subscription" tab on zyBooks to check your ID (we posted [a screenshot on Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/page/view.php?id=1639309) of where to find it).

* make sure it is not empty
* if it is not empty, verify that it has **7-digits** WITHOUT any dashes 

If you don't fix your ID, you will **automatically fail this course**, because we will be unable to transfer your grades from zyBooks to the gradebook on Gauchospace.

I hope that this is helpful.

See you in class!

Prof. K
