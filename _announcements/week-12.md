# 🏆 Wrap-up and Thank you! 🌟

Congratulations on making it to the end of the quarter and this academic year!

The final scores are out!

✅ Replacement quiz scores are released. Your replacement quiz grade is a sum of the two quiz components: your multiple-choice Gauchospace score and the score for the code portion you submitted on Gradescope.

✅ Your final project and the extra credit are released on Gradescope as well. 

⏰ Regrade requests close on **Wed, June 15 at 9PM** to ensure that we have enough time to submit the grades to the registrar. We will transfer the scores to Gauchospace after the regrade request window closes. 
- Please, follow the [regrade request guidelines]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/quiz#regrade-requests). Make sure that you run your code with the displayed input to verify the error, __before__ submitting your regrade request.
- For the Gauchospace quiz, there's a link in the quiz description to a form through which you can submit your regrade request for those questions.

 Please, **do not contact any of the course mentors about your grades**, since they are not involved in issuing or managing the grades. If you have questions about the autograder results, please use the "Regrade" button on the manually-graded question. If you need to send me an email, please remember to **include "CSW 8" in the subject**.

I do, however, encourage you to email the mentors to let them know if you found their help valuable. This course would not be possible without their tireless hard work, camaraderie, and dedication. Do not hesitate to send a thank-you note to [Ajit, Apurv, Christos, Deept, Justin, Liu, Nicholas, Nikunj, Saikumar, Sara, Vaishnavi, and Xinyu]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/staff) - they would love to hear from you.💕

Last but not least, a big thank you to you, my dear students: Thank you for taking CSW 8 this quarter, for sticking with it until the end, and for contributing in whatever ways you were able to. I loved connecting with you during our class Zoom sessions, office hours, individual meetings, weekend reviews; I enjoyed seeing your forum posts and reading weekly reflections.

I wish you all a fantabulous summer! Good luck with your summer class(es), internships/jobs, goals and plans. I hope that you will carve out some time for a real, restorative break.

All the best wishes, Prof K
