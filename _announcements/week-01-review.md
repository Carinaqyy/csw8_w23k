Happy Aloha Friday! üå∫

You successfully made it to the end of Week 1!üèùÔ∏è Congratulations!

We know that the start of the class (and the quarter in general!) might feel overwhelming.
This is expected and is normal. 
We promise that after the second week, you'll start getting more comfortable with the course structure.
We look forward to seeing you maximize your use of the various resources available to you in this class.

Here are the links that from our [course Syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about/#course-tools) that we recommend bookmarking:
* [Gauchospace]({{site.aux_links.Gauchospace}}) (the main hub for the course: grades, schedule, weekly reflection links, quizzes, all course links), 
* [zybooks]({{site.aux_links.zyBooks}}) (our online textbook with PAs, CAs, LAs), 
* [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) (Q&A forum)
* [Gradescope]({{site.aux_links.Gradescope}}) (quizzes, some labs, project) - since we are not using it yet, don't worry about it 
* [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar/) (weekly topics and due dates; from there, you can easily get to the [Schedule]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/) that lists the office hours)

If you haven't already done so, please complete the action items that we posted for you in our first announcement (you can see it in the ["Getting Started" post on the website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/announcements/) or under the Week 1 tab on Gauchospace. 
> <span style="color:orange"> Your success in this course will largely depend on how carefully you read and follow the instructions.</span>

Each week of the course will have its own dedicated tab on Gauchospace and will list the weekly pattern, your TODOs, and relevant resources for that week.
* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the Wednesday lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)
* The questions/answers and the code that came up during class are added to the last section in zyBooks: see the [class notes from Week 1](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UCSBCMPSCW8KharitonovaSpring2022/chapter/1/section/22).
* A lot of your questions are being added to the [course FAQ page]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq/), which you can easily search.


## ‚è∞ Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞
As you can see on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-1), the due dates this week included:
* ‚è∞  **Thursday 10PM**: complete the zyLabs with the word "Checkpoint" in their title (see a note below)
* ‚è∞  **Sunday 10PM**: fill out the **Welcome survey** and submit it by on Gauchospace (see the bottom of the Week 1 tab there)

_Note_ that since this is Week 1 and some students got off the waitlist a bit late, we will be giving full LA01 checkpoint credit for the lab submissions that passed at least one test in any of the checkpoint labs. (If you simply ran the default template in the breakout room lab, you already got at least 3 points there üéä).

The deadlines **next week** are:
* ‚è∞ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA01, PA02**
* ‚è∞ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA01, CA02**
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA01** - all non-optional Week 1 zyLabs
* ‚è∞ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA02 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 2 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ‚è∞ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace


To facilitate team interactions and ensure that you know how to post on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) (our Q&A forum), we asked you to post your intro in the respective lab post there.
- scroll to the bottom of the posts on the left sidebar to see the first posts (one for each lab section) 
- respond in the one that corresponds to the lab that you attended/plan to attend.



## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track
By the end of Sunday, _ideally_, you should be finished with PAs for Week 1 and Week 2 zyBook chapters and done with the CAs for most of their sections.

[Looking ahead to Week 2]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-2), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Finish reading zyBooks Week 1 and Week 2 chapters
* Write down anything that's unclear and questions to ask during class
* Work on completing Week 1 lab activities (LA01) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) (you can watch the class recording to see how to make a new post/post a follow-up)
* Take a practice quiz on Gauchospace to test your understanding

Welcome to the course! We look forward to working with you!

Prof. K and the mentors
