# üé± Week 8: More Advanced Functions and Strings

Dear all,

Congratulations on making it past Week 8!

 - During class, we had a hands-on demo on Tuesday on how to set up and get started with the files for the Week 8 mini-project. On Thursday, we had an iClicker review, going over some of the concepts from Weeks 6-8. 
    - See the posted slides and videos under the respective tab on Gauchospace for more information. 
    - We encourage you to carefully go over sections in chapter 8 on zybooks for topics such as string slicing, string methods, multiple function outputs, etc. Text processing is a very common task, so knowing how to get it done quickly with Python's help will help you achieve a wizard status.
 - During labs, we went over some important concepts on strings (and different methods that you can use with them) and functions (pass by assignment, default parameter values, and multiple return values!).


## ‚è∞ Week 8 and 9 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

As you can see on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-8), the deadlines **this week** are:
* ‚è∞ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA09**
* ‚è∞ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA09**
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA08** - all non-optional Week 8 zyLabs - _should be submitted to the **Gradescope assignment**_
* ‚è∞ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA09 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 9 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ‚è∞ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** 


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track

* Work on completing this week's lab activities (LA08) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) 
* **Start early**, since solving and debugging the labs (and your final project) at the last moment are a sure way to easily get in trouble. Plan to get the labs finished by Friday - this way, if you do not meet this goal, you still have a few days to recover and get your questions answered.


## Week 9 TODO:
* Watch the **Recursion video** that's been posted under the Week 9 tab on Gauchospace. üíé
    - Watch the video _before_ reading the chapter, since it shows you how to approach solving recursive problems.     
    - Keep the reference handout nearby (it's linked on Gauchospace under the video). Consult it as you are working through the zyBook sections this week - pay close attention to the example code shown in the zyBooks Figures (run it, examine the parts of the code and how they map to the concepts on the handout, see if you can write it yourself from scratch, especially in Sections 9.1 - 9.5).
    - Watch the videos listed in zyBooks Section 9.7 (_Recursion: Additional resources_) - the concept of the **stack frame**, which is described in the second video, is crucial for understanding recursion.

* Since we expect you to watch the videos before completing the zyBook activities, **we will _not_ have a synchronous class on Tuesday (May 24)**.
    - Quiz 6 will open up at **10:30am on Gauchospace** - you do not need to be on Zoom to take it. 
        - Read the Quiz description and follow its instructions precisely.
        - Take the **Practice Gradescope quiz (Week 8)** posted under the Week 8 tab on Gauchospace - it will give you a chance to practice submitting your code to Gradescope.
    - Thursday class will be dedicated to your questions about recursion and Week 8 labs.

 

## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources

- Some of you might encounter the `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`. Take a look at the [Troubleshooting guide and the examples listed there]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/debug/#recursionerror-maximum-recursion-depth-exceeded) to help you fix your solution.
    - Exploiting self-similarity (Recursion) is one of the fundamental Comp Sci topics, which will repeatedly come up in future CS courses.
    - If you have additional recursion resources that you found helpful, please share it with everyone by posting on the forum.

* Check out this helpful resource on [strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp). We encourage you to try out the examples there and don‚Äôt hesitate to use print statements to understand what each method does!
    

* Here is an awesome, fun 3-min video that showcases a real programming task done in Python: [If Programming Was An Anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO9UjSeLew). 
    * If you have 5 minutes, take a look at this video explaining [why you NEED math for programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI) (same creator as the previous video).
    * Warning: Do not click on any "related links" for suggested YouTube videos. You have been warned.
