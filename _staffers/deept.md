HHi Everyone! I'm a first year master's student in CS at UCSB. A bit about me - I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering in 2018. After that, I worked as a Backend Developer at Flipkart - an Ecommerce company in India. While my preferred language to code in is Java, I absolutely love convenient and simple Python is for people just starting to learn how to code. I've built some cool things using Python, the coolest thing I've built is a stock prediction system! I'm really excited to meet you all virtually, and to guide you through this exciting journey of programming!
