Hey! My name is Nicholas Wenstad and I am a third year Computer Science student! My passion for Computer Science began during my first year at UCSB, before I had even decided to switch into the Computer Science major. The first coding course that I took was CS8 in the Winter Quarter of 2020 and I was pretty intimidated since I had no coding experience at all. The environment that was created by Prof. K and the mentors of the course made it very inviting and easy to ask for help on anything that was confusing, which helped me excel in the course and created a strong foundation for the future of my collegiate career. As a ULA, I will strive to create a similar environment for students, as I know what it is like to be completely new to these challenging concepts. Now in my third year, I feel very confident in my computer science knowledge and look back at how far I have come since my first year. Please do not feel intimidated to ask for help or contact me with any question you might have! I want to help you succeed and develop a deep understanding of the concepts of Computer Science!

In my free time, I love to do anything outdoors such as camping, hiking, or any recreational sports. Before COVID I played many intramural sports at UCSB like basketball and flag football which I found to be a great way to meet people and take a break from the stress of school. I am a huge Denver Broncos fan and am in the championship round of my fantasy football league so letâ€™s hope I bring home that $700 1st place prize. I am also a huge fan of anything Star Wars and Marvel, and love watching the midnight releases of their new TV shows and movies!

I am looking forward to interacting and meeting you all this quarter!
