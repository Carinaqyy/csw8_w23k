Greetings and welcome to CS 8! I'm Bobby Briggs, a 3rd-year computer science major who's excited to be your Undergraduate Learning Assistant this quarter. Throughout my studies, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects including a real-time weather app, a simple social media platform, a CNN based image classifier and even a Python replica of Minecraft. I've also gained valuable experience in the software industry through roles at Qualcomm, Seaside Consultants Group, and Meijun Technologies. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy staying active and participating in activities like pickleball, poker, lacrosse, swimming, surfing, and golf. If you have any questions or just want to chat about all things software, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to working with all of you and helping you succeed in this class.
