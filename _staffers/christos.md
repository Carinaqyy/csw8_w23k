I am a first year PhD student at the CS Department of UCSB. I really enjoy teaching students. My research interests include AI, Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience. Back in Greece, I played water polo professionally. I also hold a degree in classical music composition so in my free time you will probably find me practicing classical guitar. Feel free to reach out to me, I would be more than happy to help you with any question.
