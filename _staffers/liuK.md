Hi everyone, my name is Liubov (or Liu as a short variant). I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the CS department. I spend the Fall21 semester fully online due to the visa issues and this is my first semester on campus :) I am happy to be a newbie because it means there is a great journey ahead, and not a bit less great journey awaits you on CS8. We all, instructors, TA’s, ULA’s here to help you not only to complete this journey but to enjoy it as much as you could. Fun fact, when I was a freshman and had a similar course, my teacher had to hide from me and tons of my repeating questions. And believe me, many of them were very obvious as I understand now. So if you need someone who won’t be bothered by the 1000th same question - I am here for you, same as all TA, and ULA, and instructors, because we all were in your shoes.
Outside computer science, I love board games, hiking, and swimming.
Looking forward to meeting you all online on CS8 and on campus.
