Hi guys, welcome to CS8! This is Xinyu, a second-year Master's student in Computer Science, also one of your TAs this quarter. This could be the first coding class for some of you and if so, you may see a steep learning curve at the beginning, but no worries, as we will try our best to help you get it done, and I promise, coding is not that hard :)
