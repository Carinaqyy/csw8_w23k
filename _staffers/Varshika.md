Hello people, welcome to CSW8! 
My name is Varshika Srinivasavaradhan, and you can call me Varshika/Varsh. 
I am a 1st year PhD student in the CS Department and my research focus is currently broadly in the Networks field and specifically in Internet Measurement and ICTD areas.
Prior to joining UCSB in 2022, I worked for Amazon Web Services for a year and a half and before that, I graduated with a Masters in CS from Purdue University.
I was one of the Teaching Assistants for this course last quarter, so please feel free to ask me any questions. 

During my leisure time, I lift weights and practice Muay Thai. I also enjoy taking long walks along the beach.
