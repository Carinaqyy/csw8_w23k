Hello! My name is Yanchen and I'm a 2nd year Master student in Computer Science. I've dabbled in Computational Linguistics research before when I was at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I earn a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Linguistics. My current research interests lean more into the field of Human-Computer Interaction, so things like AR/VR, and creating expressive computational technologies for artists, designers, and engineers.

Outside of academic work, I enjoy making crafts, generative art, reading about UX design, etc. Not very musically talented but I love it regardless. 
Ooh and I have a cat! Her name's Obi. (She might try to make an appearance on Zoom.)
