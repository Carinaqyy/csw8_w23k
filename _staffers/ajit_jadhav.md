Hi everyone! I am a first-year master's student in the CS department. I have experience working as a backend developer where I used Django (Python web framework) to develop backend systems for AI-based chatbot automation systems.
I would love to help students learn to code and work on interesting projects. Hope you guys have a great time learning with this course!
