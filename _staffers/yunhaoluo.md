Hi everyone! My name is Yunhao, and I am a third-year CS major. This is my second quarter being a ULA. I am super excited to meet you all and help you through this amazing course. Like many of you, CS 8 was the very first CS class I ever took at UCSB. I do believe that this class helped me to lay a solid foundation in understanding some of the most fundamental concepts in computing. I really enjoyed this class. There were definitely obstacles throughout the journey, especially when trying to understand a concept for the first time or being stuck on a bug for so long. However, I and other TAs/ULAs are here to support you, so don’t hesitate to reach out to us for help! This is also why I love being a ULA and computer science major because no matter whether it’s in school or out there in the real world, we have always been trying to create a supportive community. 
I really love python. Learning it at the early stage of my CS journey quickly enlarged my skillset. The abundant python packages allowed me to explore different fields like data science and app development even when I was still new to programming. Some of the packages are also easy to learn and super handy in a lot of places. The most recent little project I did was a simple desktop game using a python GUI package. I’d love to show off to anyone who is interested and talk about it!
Outside of programming, I love hiking, playing basketball, and just going for a walk. I am also a fan of aviation. I love everything about airplanes, and hope I can one day get my private license!
I look forward to an incredible quarter with you all!
