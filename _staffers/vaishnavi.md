Hi everyone! My name is Vaishnavi, and I'm a first year CS major. This is my first time being an ULA, so I'm kind of nervous, but super excited to get to know you all! 

In my free time, I love volunteering, reading, exploring the hiking/biking trails at UCSB, and trying out new restaurants. I'm also part of SWE (Society
of women Engineers) and WICS (Women in Computer Science) at UCSB.

Although I never took CS8, python was also the first coding language I learned, so I understand how hard it can get for people who never programmed
before. I still struggle/ have struggled with a lot of CS classes this year, so I understand exactly how hard it can get when learning something
you've never done before while juggling other classes. One thing that helped me get through this struggle is to reach out for help to TAs and the Professors,
and it has really helped me a lot. So, please don't hesitate to reach out for any CS related questions or UCSB in general!

Can't wait to meet you guys!
