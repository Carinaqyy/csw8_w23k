Hi everyone! My name is Roman Aguilera. I am a 6th year PhD student. My research is at the intersection of machine learning and robotic control. Currently my research studies how reinforcement learning algorithms perform as the dimensionality of a robotic system increases. Besides work, I enjoy weight lifting, competitive video games, and basketball. I look forward to helping you learn more about Computer Science this quarter! Feel free to reach out about any questions you may have :)
